# Changelog

  - `ticket_amount`, amount needed to pay due to some kind of penalty
  - `interest_amount`, interest amount
  - `discount_amount`, amount that will be reduced because of a discount
  - `total_amount`, equals nominal_amount + ticket_amount + interest_amount - discount_amount
  - `api_related`, `true` if `Sale` was created by the API, `false` otherwise
